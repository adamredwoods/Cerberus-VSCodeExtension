Visual Studio Code extension for Cerberus Programming Language

To use, download the VSIX file, then in VSCode select the Extensions Tab and click the 3-dot menu and "Install from VSIX". Select the VSIX file.
You may need to click the reload prompt in the corner. Afterwards, find the extension configuration and set the transcc path for your system.

To build, find the command menu (control-shift-p) and type Cerberus to select which build you would like. Hotkeys can be assigned. The extension offers configuration for build arguments.
